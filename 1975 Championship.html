		<!-- 1975 Championship Story -->
		<p class="ChampionshipStory"> 
				The 1975 NBA World Championship Series marked the culmination of the 1974–75 NBA season in the National Basketball Association. This championship round featured
				the Western Conference champions, the Golden State Warriors (48–34), facing off against the Eastern Conference champions, the Washington Bullets (60–22), in a 
				best-of-seven series. Despite being considered the underdogs, the Warriors achieved a stunning four-game sweep of the heavily favored Bullets to claim the championship 
				title. The series MVP honor was bestowed upon Rick Barry with averages of 29.5 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 2.4 apg, the small forward for the Warriors. 		
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
				During this series, the Warriors' home games took place at the Cow Palace in Daly City, located near San Francisco. This change in venue was necessitated by scheduling 
				conflicts at their usual home court, the Oakland Arena, during the week of May 19–26. Additionally, due to Golden State's inability to secure the Cow Palace for Memorial 
				Day Weekend (May 24–26), an unconventional scheduling format was adopted. A Sports Illustrated article covering the series mentioned that Washington, as the team with home 
				court advantage, had the choice between a 1-2-2-1-1 scheduling format or opening the series on the road and hosting Games 2, 3, and 4. The Bullets opted for the 1-2-2-1-1 format,
				not necessarily for fairness but because they preferred to start the series at their home court.
