	<!-- 1956 Championship Story-->
	<p class="ChampionshipStory">  
			Following a season of adapting to the new regulations, the NBA thrived during its second attempt at the up-tempo style of play. The league's scoring average surged
			to 99 points per team per game, emphasizing quickness and athletic prowess like never before. Bob Pettit, an exciting rookie who joined the Milwaukee Hawks in the 
		 	1954-55 season, claimed the league's scoring title with an average of 25.7 points per game during his team's debut season in St. Louis. He also claimed the Finals MVP 
			Award with the incredible averages of 30.1 ppg, 18.3 rpg, and 2.4 apg.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
			Pettit made history by becoming the first MVP in NBA history after leading the league not only in scoring but also in rebounds, with an impressive 16.2 per game, in only 
			his second NBA season. Despite his remarkable achievements, the Hawks finished with a record of 33-39 and lost a tiebreaker to the Minneapolis Lakers, who secured the second 
			spot in the Western Division. Baltimore had folded the previous year, resulting in an eight-team league where division champions received a bye in the first round of the playoffs.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
			Philadelphia and Fort Wayne emerged as the victors in the East and West Divisions, respectively, earning themselves first-round byes. Syracuse, despite losing the tiebreaker for third
			place in the East, managed to defeat Boston in the Eastern semifinals. Out West, St. Louis lost the tiebreaker to Minneapolis but overcame the Lakers in the Western semifinals.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
			Both Philadelphia and Fort Wayne won their division finals in five games. Led by the talents of Paul Arizin, rookie Tom Gola, and veteran Neil Johnston, the Warriors convincingly defeated 
			the Pistons in the NBA Finals. Arizin played a pivotal role in securing the championship, showcasing his diverse offensive skills, which included long-range shots, corner jumpers, driving layups, 
			and even hook shots. Despite a two-year absence due to military service, Arizin seamlessly adapted to the new up-tempo style, which played to his strengths of agility and scoring ability. During 
			the 1956 playoffs, Arizin scored an impressive 289 points, a feat only surpassed by Mikan in postseason history. With the support of Gola and Jack George in the backcourt, as well as the formidable 
			presence of Johnston at center, the 6-foot-4 Arizin proved to be an unstoppable scoring machine that opposing teams struggled to contain.
