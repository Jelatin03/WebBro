	<!-- 1947 Championship Story -->
	<p class="ChampionshipStory"> 
			In the inaugural season of the National Basketball Association (which was initially known as the Basketball Association of America until its merger with the National
			Basketball League in 1949), Howie Dallmar was among just four players who managed to accumulate over 100 assists in the 1946-47 season. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
			In securing the Philadelphia Warriors' first championship in the league, it was a crucial basket made by the 6-foot-4 guard, rather than an assist, that made the difference. 
			Throughout the championship series against the Chicago Stags, who had won 39 games compared to Philadelphia's 35 in the regular season, Dallmar had been hindered by callused 
			feet. After the Warriors, led by the league's top scorer also the Finals top scorer Joe Fulks averaging 26.2 points per game, quickly gained a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-7 series, Dallmar wasn't expected to play a significant role 
			in Game 5 at the old Philadelphia Arena on Market Street.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
			“No one expected him to play,” said Eddie Gottlieb, coach of the Warriors, who kept Dallmar out of the starting lineup so he could rest his feet. “But 
			he sat there, pestering me to let him in. When it came down to that point where I thought we might win the game, I sent him in, and he was the ultimate 
			difference.”
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
			
			Although Joe Fulks continued to be the primary scorer for Philadelphia, contributing 34 points, it was a crucial basket made by Dallmar in the final minute of the game 
			that shattered an 80-80 deadlock and propelled the Warriors to an 83-80 win, securing the championship title.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
			“I scored the winning basket, which gave me a total of two points for the game. It was from the outside and I think it bounced about four times before it went 
			it,” recalled Dallmar, who like the rest of his teammates received $2,000 and a ring with a diamond chip in it for winning the championship.
