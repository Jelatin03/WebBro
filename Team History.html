			<i>1946 Warriors Team</i>

	<!-- Team History Description -->
	<p class="TeamHistoryDescription"> 
		Established in 1946, the Warriors originated in Philadelphia and were among the founding members of the BAA. Notably, the team secured the league's inaugural championship 
		with the standout performance of future Hall of Famer Joe Fulks, who also became the BAA's first scoring leader. Following a loss in the BAA finals the subsequent season, 
		the Warriors became part of the NBA in 1949 when the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL). In their initial six seasons in the new league, the Warriors struggled
		to finish above fourth place in their division, with an exception in 1955–56. During that season, led by forward Paul Arizin and center Neil Johnston, the Warriors achieved the 
		best record in the league and clinched their first NBA title. 
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		In 1959, Philadelphia made a significant addition to their team by acquiring local talent Wilt Chamberlain, who later became one of the greatest players in NBA history. Chamberlain 
		achieved basketball immortality during his time with the Warriors by famously scoring a record-breaking 100 points in a 1962 game, marking the team's concluding year in Philadelphia.
	 	Following the 1961–62 season, a consortium of investors from the San Francisco Bay area bought the franchise and relocated the team, leading to its new identity as the San Francisco Warriors. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		The Warriors made it to the NBA finals in 1964 with a team led by Chamberlain and again in 1967 with a significantly revamped roster that included key players like forward Rick Barry, center
		Nate Thurmond, and guard-forward Jeff Mullins. Unfortunately, they experienced defeat on both occasions. Barry, a league scoring leader in 1966–67, made history by being among the first stars 
		to depart the NBA for the emerging American Basketball Association. He signed with the Oakland Oaks the following year. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		In the 1969–70 season, Al Attles, a former Warriors player, assumed the role of the team's head coach and continued to lead the franchise for a span of 14 seasons. In 1971, grappling with financial 
		challenges, the franchise relocated to Oakland in the East Bay and underwent a name change to the Golden State Warriors. The turning point came in the 1974–75 season when, under the leadership of Barry
		(who had returned in 1972), the Warriors surprisingly defeated the favored Washington Bullets in the NBA finals. Attles made history as the first African American full-time head coach to win an NBA 
		title; Bill Russell had previously achieved a championship as a player-coach. Despite making postseason appearances in the following two years, the Warriors experienced a significant decline in performance, 
		finishing last in their division in five of the nine seasons between 1977–78 and 1985–86.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		In the late 1980s, the Warriors gained recognition for the distinctive up-tempo playing style under head coach Don Nelson. This approach relied on smaller players, prioritizing scoring over defense. The most 
		emblematic period was marked by the 1989–90 and 1990–91 teams, famously known as "Run T.M.C.," a nod to the rap group Run D.M.C. This trio comprised point guard Tim Hardaway, shooting guard Mitch Richmond, and 
		small forward Chris Mullin, showcasing high-scoring performances. Despite the entertaining play, Nelson's teams failed to progress beyond the second round in the playoffs during this period, leading to his departure 
		in the 1994–95 season. Subsequently, the Warriors entered a challenging phase, registering last- and second-to-last-place finishes in nearly every season from 1994–95 to 2005–06. Nelson returned to coach the Warriors 
		in the 2006–07 season, leading the team to its first playoff appearance in 13 years. The Warriors achieved a historic feat by becoming the first eighth-seeded team to eliminate a top-seeded team in a seven-game postseason 
		series, defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the first round.
